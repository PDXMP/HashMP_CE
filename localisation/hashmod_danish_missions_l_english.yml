 hashmp.111.title:0 "The Danish Succession"
 hashmp.111.desc:0 "The sudden death of King Christopher III has sent Denmark into yet another crisis. The succession must be resolved quickly before a civil war potentially happens. The privy council has declared that an election will take place, the nobles of the realm will make the decision of who is to rule the nation."
 hashmp.111.a:0 "King Christian, the German Prince."

 hashmp.110.title:0 "The Kalmar Union"
 hashmp.110.desc:0 "The reign of King Christopher III has so far been a disaster, seeing the loss of the Kalmar Union. The armies under Sweden successfully sacked Copenhagen, which resulted in a treaty being signed soon after. The terms declared that we must renounce our rulership over both Sweden and Norway, we had no choice but to accept. This defeat is still recent and has left both the upper and lower classes bitter and angry. The nation grieves and civil unrest is growing amongst the peasantry whom suffered the most from the war. It is the decision of the privy council that a choice must be made before we move on to recover the nation. Is it time to forget the dreams of a Scandinavian Union? or will we once again take up arms to restore our rightful claim over their realms."
 hashmp.110.a:0 "The Kalmar Union will be restored."
 hashmp.110.b:0 "Recovering our Kingdom should remain our priority."
