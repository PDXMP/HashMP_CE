 hashmp.101.title:0 "The Army Reforms of [SWE.Monarch.GetName]"
 hashmp.101.desc:0 "Having only recently secured our independence from the now disolved Kalmar Union, it has been put into question what lessons should be learned and how we can better organize our army. Your generals have put forward two possible reforms for the army but we can't afford to implement them both."
 hashmp.101.a:0 "Focus on reorganizing our Infantry regiments."
 hashmp.101.b:0 "Focus on reorganizing the Leadership of our armies."
 hashmp.102.title:0 "The Gå-På Military Doctrine"
 hashmp.102.desc:0 "The Gå-På (literally "Go-On") method was based on shock tactics and was the standard combat technique used historically in the Swedish army during the 17th and 18th century. This very aggressive tactic often resulted in short-lived successful battles against superior numbers of the enemy. According to army regulations of 1694 and 1701, the infantry attack operated as follows: In four ranks with gaps, a Swedish battalion would march "smoothly and slowly" towards the enemy lines, braving enemy fire that often started at a distance of approximately 100 metres. The Swedish soldiers were told not to fire until "you could see the whites in the enemies eyes", a range of roughly 50 metres. When the marching drums stopped the two rear ranks would fill the gaps within the two foremost ranks and fire a salvo, then draw their swords. The two rear ranks would then move back to their previous position, and the two foremost ranks would close the gaps in their lines, after which the battalion would resume their attack. The two foremost ranks would discharge their muskets in a final volley when they were within range to charge—a distance of roughly 20 metres. At these ranges, the powerful muskets usually felled many enemy troops, having a great physical and psychological impact on opponents."
 hashmp.102.a:0 "Adopt the doctrine."
 hashmp.102.b:0 "We have no need to change our doctrine."
 hashmp.103.title:0 "The Alexander of the North"
 hashmp.103.desc:0 "The once mighty Tsar of Russia has fallen beneath the now rising Swedish nation. Upon your return to the capital, your regiments stand before you and hail you as the Alexander of the North, a most honorary title for any monarch. Sweden now stands strong and uncontested in the Baltic, the path to a Swedish Empire has been forged. Your achievements will go down legendary in the history books and you will not be forgotten. The many Kings and Queens that shall reign after your passing, shall forever envy the legacy you have made for yourself."

 swedish_reform_1_title:0 "Centralize Sweden"
 swedish_reform_1_desc:0 "The support of the nobility was crucial during the Swedish War of Liberation but now the state remains held back with the nobility feuding and pushing their own agendas. Power must be centralized in favour of the crown if we wish to move forward as a country."
 swedish_reform_2_title:0 "Extensive Tax Reform"

 swedish_reform_3_title:0 "Allotment System"

 swedish_military_2_title:0 "Innovative Warfare"

The Carolean army is regarded as one of the most effective military forces of their time."
