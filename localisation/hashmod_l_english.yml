 ger_3_desc:0 "The German General Staff, originally the Prussian General Staff, was responsible for the continuous study of warfare, and the drawing up and reviewing of plans for mobilization or offensive campaigns. The Generalstab was distinguished as the earliest and most efficient of European centralized military commands, and enjoyed significant political leeway. This granted the German armed forces a significcant advantage against other continental opponents."

 ger_5_desc:0 "German bureaucracy enacts laws concerning the daily life of citizens of the empire to secure the local peace and public morality.

 ger_6_desc:0 "The House of Thurn und Taxis pioneered the German postal service, a complex network of the communication which covers various European regions and all of Germany."
 ger_7_desc:0 "One of the effects of the unification policies was the gradually increasing tendency to eliminate the use of non-German languages in public life, schools and academic settings with the intent of pressuring the non-German population to abandon their national identity in what was called "Germanisation". These policies were targeted against Polish-speaking and south-German populations, increased percentages of german speaking populations in core regions, and allowed for a centrally unified education and beauracratic system."
